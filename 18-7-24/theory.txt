shared_ptr - <memory>
    multiple shared_ptr instances can share ownership of an object
    object is destroyed when the last shared_ptr owning is destroyed

    prevent memory leaks


Weak_ptr :
    similar to shared_ptr
    but it will not maintain reference count
    further pointer will not have strong hold on the object
    no circular dependency

disadvantages of shared_ptr:
    since it is maintaining reference counter it will have a circular dependency
    created by two or more object pointing to each other
